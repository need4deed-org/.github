## 🧭 How Can I Contribute?

### Your First Code Contribution

Not sure where to start?
Look through [good first issues](https://github.com/orgs/need4deed-org/projects) labeled `good first issue` in the appropriate repository.

Our main repositories:

| Repository                                            | Description                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`fe`](https://github.com/need4deed-org/fe)           | Next.js PWA — main app for automating Need4Deed processes |
| [`be`](https://github.com/need4deed-org/be)           | Node.js / TypeScript API for the app                      |
| [`sdk`](https://github.com/need4deed-org/sdk)         | Shared TypeScript types and utilities between FE and BE   |
| [`website`](https://github.com/need4deed-org/website) | React/Vite static landing page (currently frozen)         |

---

## 🚀 Your First Pull Request

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Go to the repo you want to contribute to (e.g. [`fe`](https://github.com/need4deed-org/fe))
2. Click **Fork** (top-right)
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

We prefer using `yarn`. You may use other package manager, but please make sure:

1. `pre-commit` script is invoked before committing
2. do not clutter a repo with a lock file other than `yarn.lock`
3. `yarn.lock` is up to date.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
yarn install
```

### Step 3: Add the Original Repository as a Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/need4deed-org/<repo-name>.git
git remote -v
```

You should see:

- `origin` → your fork
- `upstream` → the official Need4Deed repository

### Step 4: Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b your_nick-feature-title
```

Example:
`git checkout -b anna-fix-login-form`

---

## 💻 Development Setup

### Monorepo-style workflow

We maintain three sibling repositories that work closely together:

```
parent/
├── fe/         # Frontend (Next.js PWA)
├── be/         # be (API)
└── sdk/        # Shared types and helpers
```

### SDK Linking

The **SDK** shares TypeScript types between the **frontend** and **be**.
We don’t fetch it from npm — we use the **local sibling folder** approach instead.

1. Make sure you have the latest branches checked out in each repo:

   ```bash
   cd sdk && git pull origin <branch>
   cd ../fe && git pull origin <branch>
   cd ../be && git pull origin <branch>
   ```

2. In `fe` and `be`, upgrade SDK locally:

   ```bash
   yarn upgrade need4deed-sdk
   ```

3. Ensure that the **current branch name** is checked out in all three repos. `fe` and `be` default branches are `develop`, `sdk` default branch is `main`. You may use feature branches as well! In such a case
   > 🔄 if you get TypeScript errors, make sure `sdk` and `be` or `fe` are aligned and freshly pulled.

### Content of a contribution

Please ensure all code changes directly address the issue. Minor flaws, such as a typo, may be corrected; however, if you make such corrections, please note them in the PR comments.

### Step 5: Open the PR

```bash
git push origin your_nick-feature-title
```

then go to the forked repo on your GitHub account and open the PR.
And please make sure your opened PR is wired with the issue by using a keyword, e.g. `closes` followed by the link to the issue: `#<number of issue>`

## 🎨 Design Guidelines

All UI and UX designs are maintained in **Figma**.
Before implementing any new feature or layout change:

- Always refer to the **Figma file** shared by the design team
- Match the spacing, typography, and component structure
- Discuss any deviations with the design lead before committing

> Consistency between Figma and implementation helps ensure a unified user experience.

---

## 🧩 Frontend Notes

- **FE** is a **Next.js** progressive web app (PWA)
- You can manually test a page by visiting its URL directly
- The legacy **website (Vite)** remains online but is **frozen**
- Future plan: merge the landing page into the `fe` app

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug:

- Check if it’s already reported under **Issues** in the relevant repository

If not, open a [new issue](https://github.com/need4deed-org) using the **bug report template**.

## 💡 Suggesting Features

Feature requests are tracked as GitHub issues too.
